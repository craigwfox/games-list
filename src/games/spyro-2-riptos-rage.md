  body: I enjoyed this game quite a lot, but I think I played it a bit too soon
    after playing Spyro 1. It really kinda feels a lot like the first game. That
    said itâ€™s still quite a bit of fun and I did collect close to 100% of all
    items. Pretty fun platforming, some of the bosses got a bit annoying, just
    seemed so slow waiting for the stupid birds to drop items. I also have a
    love hate relationship with the speedway levels.
