## My notes

### 3D World

This was my first time playing 3D world. For the most part I liked the levels and power ups and how levels were built around them. There are a lot of levels that are made pointless because of the cat suit, but that’s just kind of fun to do ha. Roselina was a lot of fun at the end, but she does start to feel required for many end levels. The only big flaw for me was the depth perception seemed to get really awkward at times and I’d also lose my character quite a bit. Another issue I had was how annoying it would be to get to a spot that you needed a specific power up and would have to exit the level and go to a different level to get the power up you need. Also the game seems to want you to play each level with every character but there really seems to be no reason to do that.

### Bowser’s Fury

I loved every bit of this outside of repeating the Bowser fight over and over. Lot’s of cool areas and fun platforming. Being able to stockpile power ups made it easy to swap to what you need and deal with more annoying areas.
