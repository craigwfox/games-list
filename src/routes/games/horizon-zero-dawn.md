## My Notes

<p class="gd__notes__date"><strong>Review date:</strong> 02-26-2022</p>

This was my second or third attempt at playing Horizon Zero Dawn. I had tried to play it right after playing some other open world games and just couldn't get into another. This time though it hooked me and I ended up blasting through it over a few weeks.

I played the Horizon on the easy difficulty (I just wanted to chill and explore), and it was the "Complete Edition" version of the game, which includes the Frozen Wilds DLC.

### The good

Overall the game is looks great, even playing this several years after it's release Horizon doesn't looked dated at all. I found myself collecting everything I could just to have an excuse to explore the world. Half the time I didn't even bother mounting (granted the mounts are unwieldy), instead opting to walk/run and climb up everything I could.

#### Range combat

Ranged combat is quite a bit of fun, a large variety of different speeds, power, and elemental types of weapons. It was a ton of fun figuring out different combos by swapping between the different bows and casters to handle enemies.

#### Enemies

Tons of cool enemy models, I'm not sure there was a single one that I didn't like the looks of.

The enemies had a fairly wide variety of attacks and were fun to learn their patterns and weaknesses and develop strategies to control and defeat them efficiently.

#### Dialogues and characters

Overall the dialogue and characters were a lot of fun to talk to. Lot's of interesting side stories of people just trying to get by in life while living in a world that seems to just want to kill them.

I found myself laughing out loud quite often at Aloy's constant exasperation at peoples crazy beliefs when things could be explained with science.

### The meh

#### Side character relationships

There were quite a few instances where an side character that I had only met once or twice would talk to me like we had known each other for years. Every time this felt really strange since overall the story only feels like it's taking place over a few months. This could also be a side effect of me just smashing through the game.

#### Melee combat

Outside of stealth kills you basically only have two melee attacks your slow fast attack and your very slow strong attack. I quite often would find myself stuck in a group of enemies and trying to get a strong attack off only to find my self getting chain kicked in the face.

#### Mob AI

The mob AI is pretty hilariously jank when it is unable to path to you. It will get stuck in a loop of running super far away and then coming back. This can end up being very beneficial if you are struggling with large groups of enemies.

### Conclusion

I'm not sure I will bother replaying this one, but I'm very excited to play the Horizon Zero Dawn: Forbidden West once I get a PS5.
