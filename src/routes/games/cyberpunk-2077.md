    This game has been a lot of fun for me. I’ve played through the full story
    and most major side quests as a Corpo and through a lot of the side quest
    and part of the story as a Nomad. Overall I think I’ve enjoyed a lot of the
    side quests more than the main questline. This doesn’t surprise me too much
    though. In games like Oblivion and Skyrim I generally ignore the main quests
    and do side guild stuff. I really do wish that the “factions” that built
    around the different fixers in the city had more impact and that we could
    build rep, and ally / war with them. They just seem a bit hollow.


    ## Some things I’ve liked


    The cyber hacking abilities in combat have been great. I only used a small amount of them on my Corpo play though and didn’t use them at all hardly on my Nomad and doing that has made me miss them. I plan on doing a third play through after DLC comes out on a Street Kid that almost only uses hacking.

    The talents have been fairly decent and I like being able to pretty freely mix and match perks.


    Lot’s of fun clothing, but it can be a bit of a pain to find good looking clothing that also has high stats.


    ## Indifferent


    I know a lot of people talk about melee combat being great, but I think this is only because it’s overpowered. I’ve just found it to be boring to me.


    The driving is fucking trash. Some cars just seem to handle badly at speeds that make no sense. I don’t think that going 35 mph should be causing it to slide out of control when going around tight corners. Also the “off road” cars just seem to bounce on everything. Also trash bags are the single most dangerous things to cars.
