  body: This was my second time playing this. The first time I tried to play it
    was on the Wii and while I liked the game itself I found the Wii mote
    uncomfortable to use. I ended up getting the Mario 3D pack on Switch and
    played this using the Pro Controller and enjoyed it much more. While the
    platforming in this is good, I think more than anything I enjoyed the music
    and art of this one.
