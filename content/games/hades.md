    This was my first time to really dig into a roguelike game. I've always
    enjoyed learning enemy attack patterns and dungeon layouts so maybe I
    shouldn't have waited so long. I did turn on god mode to make the game
    easier, I found myself just a bit too slow to react in a lot of cases so
    being able to do that really helped.


    ## Things I liked


    The story isn't forced on you, you could easily ignore it and just grind away. Primarily you learn the story by talking to NPC's throughout Hade's palace and a bit in the floors of the dungeons.


    The music and art, like all of Supergiant's games, is also great.


    ## Other thoughts


    I'll definitely be playing this game again/more in the future. I want to play more and try turning off god mode and maybe even dig into the heats (increases the difficulty).
